HTML
1. Using the `<nav>` tag to create a navigation bar atop the webpage.
2. Using the `rel="preconnect"` attribute in `<link>` tag to tell browser to connect to establish connections to certain resources ahead-of-time to reduce the latency of fetching fonts from Google.
3. Using `target="_blank"` attribute in `<a>` tag to open links to another page/site in a new browser tab.

CSS
1. Using `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` to style a group of elements vertically instead of horizontally in a flexbox.
2. Using `position: sticky` and `position: -webkit-sticky` to make navbar always float atop the page even when scrolling down.
3. Using `border-radius` to round out the corners of borders, making them more aethestically pleasing.
